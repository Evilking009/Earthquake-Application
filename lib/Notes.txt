// Class file generated from JSON to Dart Link
// Mapping JSON to Dart Object

// One thing we need to be careful when dealing with dart objects is the type
// sometimes we need to recieve a certain type as int/double to convert that or make sure that is indeed that type we want
// for ex if you this X is supposed to be double but its null so dart will have hard time to deal with it.
// In order to Fix this.. goto types_Helper.dart file in util folder


// FromJSON - Converts from JSON to Dart Object
// toJSON - Vice versa

// Used TypesHelper.to_int() - to forcefully convert any null value to 0, else default value
// inside Properties.fromJson(){}

// num - has both int and double

// Class with Function input num to check if data is null then 0, else return default value
// also checks if any error found then print error with return 0
